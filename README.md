# Labs

This repository is a collection of half-baked, random, and other eccentric ideas I have flying around my noggin.

This repository is organized like such:

```text
internal/
	name/
		README.md
		_poc/
			go.mod
			*.go
```

The `_poc` directory, if one exists, will contain code that may or may not compile, work, run, exist, have feelings, understand the difference between right and wrong, and other worldly and metaphysical issues.

So I guess what I'm really saying is, you probably shouldn't actually use any of this stuff. Seriously, don't. I might hide hidden `rm -rf /` calls in them, just to make sure! You've been warned.  :wink:

## Why?

My head is constantly filled with random ideas, thoughts, tools, packages, gummy bears, modules, Tom Petty songs, and unmetered poetry about a majestic buffalo roaming through lush valleys with a handsome, funny, and, let's be honest, very humble rider upon its back.

Occasionally I get some free time and get to try some of these ideas out. Some are better than others. Those that are better get "upgraded" and rewritten "properly" and become public projects. Other projects, some I would argue that are the more "fun" projects, end up on the cutting room floor that is my hard drive.

This project is my attempt to collect those ramblings and proof-of-concepts into one place.

My hope is that this repository inspires people to build amazing projects. I encourage you to play with these ideas too. Take them and make them happen. I give these ideas to the community.

If you should end up building on any of these ideas, I asked the following:

* Open a PR to this repository and add your project to the `README.md` that's appropriate to let others know what you've done.
* Use the [`github.com/gobuffalo/shoulders`](https://github.com/gobuffalo/shoulders) tool to create a `SHOULDERS.md` file in your project to give attribution to those packages/modules you use.
* Maybe give me a little shout out in the `README.md` of your project or something.

That's about it. Explore, play, and have fun with it. It's just code after all.
